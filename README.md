# BCHOntology
BCH-Ontology is an ontology developed on OWL. The basis for our BCH ontology is the merging of three existing ontologies, i.c. Geneva CityGML, MONDIS (Monument Damage) and CIDOC-CRM (International Council of Museums). To fully cover the BCH domain, a number of additional classes and properties were defined as to provide a complete semantic framework for management of BCH.
